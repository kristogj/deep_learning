# Recurrent Neural Networks for music generation.

## Setup
Install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

## Overview
**main.py**:
Main class, this is where the training, testing and graph generation is happening.

**train.py**
Training loop

**plotting.py**
Plot model stats

**models.py**:
All of our Pytorch models is located here, including the fit function, evaluation function calculating negative 
log likelihood.

**utils.py**:
Helper methods 

**generator.py**
Includes function for generating a song.

**generate_song.py**
Script for generating song with settings

**generate_heatmaps.py**
Script for generating the heatmap presented in the last task of the report.


## Configuration
Our default settings is listed below
```
config = {
    "EPOCHS": 15,
    "CHUNK_SIZE": 100,
    "VOCAB_SIZE": len(char_to_idx.keys()),
    "LR": 0.001,  # Default in Adam 0.001,
    "WEIGHT_DECAY": 0,  # Default in Adam 0
    "HIDDEN": 100,

    # For songs sampling
    "TEMPERATURE": 1,
    "TAKE_MAX_PROBABLE": False,
    "LIMIT_LEN": 300
}
```
